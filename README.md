dont expect updates to this!_

# What is it?
Paradoxical VR Shenanigans is an app that contains a collection of tools designed to make (mainly) Oculus VR bearable.

## Tools
- Disable SteamVR Home - If you can't load into SteamVR to disable the home app because it lags too much, or you just can't disable it for some reason, this helps. I made this for a friend who literally was unable to disable SteamVR home for some reason.
- Install OculusKiller - Installs [OculusKiller](https://github.com/BnuuySolutions/OculusKiller) an app that disabled Oculus Dash and replaces it with SteamVR
- Fix Quest Link White Bar - A recreation of [some old code I made](https://github.com/paradoxical-autumn/quest-link-fixer) that fixes a white bar appearing while using wired quest link.

# Downloads
Grab the most recent version from the [downloads tab!](https://github.com/paradoxical-autumn/paradoxical-vr-shenanigans/releases) Each modern release comes with an installer and a portable version. Your usecase depends on how often you'll be using the tweaks. (This is as the app automatically updates)

# Compiling from source
PVRS is written in C# so you'll need a dotnet compiler and IDE to run it.
